    <!-- Introduction -->
    <h2>Completely organized journey...</h2>
    <p>So think of this as my workout journal. Except...</p>
    <p>I'm going to be coding. Specifically creating webpages

    <p>Am I in it for the money? Of course I am. But in my defense, I enjoy coding.</p>

    I start to move onto newer and cooler things, I will link them to a new page!</p>
    <p>(By the way the sentences look different here because </br>I learned how to use
    line break!)</p>
    <p>To use a line break you type this into the area you want to break...</p>
    <xmp></br></xmp>
    <p>Well that's it for today. I will talk to you tomorrow!</p>
